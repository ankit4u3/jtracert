jTracert allows you to generate sequence diagrams directly from running java applications.

Consider you application is foo.jar. Usually you execute it like 'java -jar foo.jar'
In order to start using jTracert you need to add following JVM parameter: '-javaagent:jTracert-0.0.5.jar'
Please note that you need Java 5 or higher

jTracert can provide output data in different formats. The most convinient way is to use SDEdit application for visualizing method call traces generated by jTracert.

The scenario for using jTracert with SDEdit is described below:

 # Install SDEdit (it's absolutely free) from http://sdedit.sourceforge.net/
 # Open SDEdit
 # Choose Item "Start/stop RT server" in menu "Extras"
 # Enter any port you like and press ok
 # Add the following parameters to your application startup: "-DanalyzerOutput=sdEditRtClient -DsdEditHost=127.0.0.1 -DsdEditPort=60001 -javaagent:jTracert-0.0.3.jar"

That's it! In SDEdit window you will get the sequence diagrams describing your application runtime!

Other command line parameters are described on project wiki page: http://code.google.com/p/jtracert/wiki/CommandLineParameters

Any feedback much appreciated!
