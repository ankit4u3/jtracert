= Executing jTracert agent =

In order to start your application with jTracert agent, just add the following JVM parameter: _-javaagent:jTracert.jar_

*IMPORTANT!* you should replace jTracert.jar with correct file name, like jTracert-0.0.3.jar

If you were executing your application with command line '_java -jar yourApplicationJar.jar_', you should amend it to '_java -javaagent:jTracert.jar -jar yourApplicationJar.jar_'

javaagent option described above would turn on jTracert agent, but it will omit it's output since it's not yet configured. Let's consider configuring jTracert agent.

= Configuring jTracert agent =

== Overview ==

jTracert agent is configurable via system properties (set with -D parameter).
A typical command line for executing jTracert agent as a SDEdit realtime client is as below:

'_java -!DanalyzerOutput=sdEditRtClient -!DsdEditHost=127.0.0.1 -!DsdEditPort=60001 -javaagent:jTracert.jar -jar yourApplicationJar.jar_'
