== 9 September 2008 - big thanks for your feedback; jTracert 0.0.3 released ==

First of all, I'd like to thank the jTracert users for the feedback. This project is very young, but anyway we already have a couple hundreds of downloads and thousands visitors from the entire world. A first defect ( Issue 1 ) was opened in bug tracking system and was successfully closed.

Based on the received feedback, following two features are top priority:
  * A separate specific GUI for jTracert
  * Better perfomance and ability to work on big enterprise applications

I believe that these two features are mandatory for the first beta version release.

New features in jTracert 0.0.3:
  * New experimental support of http://www.websequencediagrams.com/ See WebSequenceDiagrams
  * Issue 1 fixed
  * Unit tests fixed
  * Various refactorings

== 9 June 2008 - jTracert 0.0.2 released ==

New features:
  * Removing duplicate method calls from jTracert output
  * Support of nested self-calls
  * [ZanthanSequence Support of Zanthan SEQUENCE file format]
  * Numerous bugfixes and performance improvements
  * CLI interface cleaned and refactored

== 31 May 2008 - jTracert 0.0.1 released ==

We're proud to present you the very first version of jTracert
