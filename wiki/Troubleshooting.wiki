#summary Common problems ant their resolution

= Introduction =

Some common problems reported by jTracert users and resolution for these problems.

= Troubles =

== jTracert show no errors, but at the same time no data is generated ==

The most probable reason is that you're using too old JVM. One of jTracert users has faced this problem on 1.5.0_01 JVM. Update to a newer version has solved the issue

== Error opening zip file: jTracert.jar == 

You may face thw following problem when starting your application together with jTracert:
"Error occurred during initialization of VM agent library failed to init: instrument Error opening zip file: jTracert.jar"

In this case, please check jTracert actuall file name.
For example it can be jTracert-0.0.5.jar, but not just jTracert.jar
Please note that you should specify the full path to the jTracert jar; not only file name

== I'm getting strange !NullPointerException from class !MethodCallTraceBuilderImpl ==

Sometimes you may face following exception:
{{{
 java.lang.NullPointerException
 	at com.google.code.jtracert.traceBuilder.impl.MethodCallTraceBuilderImpl.leave(MethodCallTraceBuilderImpl.java:323)
}}}
This is caused by JVM bytecode limitations - we cannot insert new code before parent constructor call.

A partial fix was dilevered in Issue 9 fix - jTracert release 0.0.5

If you're still getting this exception, try to expand the set of instrumented classes (or just remove classNameRegEx parameter) - see CommandLineParameters page.
