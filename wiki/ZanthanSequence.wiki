#summary Using jTracert together with Zanthan SEQUENCE application

= Introduction =

Zanthan SEQUENCE is another application for drawing sequence diagrams.
You can download it from following page: http://www.zanthan.com/itymbi/archives/cat_sequence.html

= Generating SEQUENCE files using jTracert =

Start jTracert with following command line parameters:
_java *-!DanalyzerOutput=sequenceFileSystem -!DoutputFolder=/tmp/sq -javaagent:jTracert.jar* -jar yourApplication.jar_

*IMPORTANT!* you should replace jTracert.jar with correct file name, like jTracert-0.0.5.jar

jTracert will generate SEQUENCE diagrams to the specified folder /tmp

Example file content is like below:
{{{
net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/Configurator$1.run {
    net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/configurators/StringSelectionConfigurator._actionPerformed {
        net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/configurators/StringSelectionConfigurator.applyValue {
            net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/Bean.setValue {
                net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/Bean.getStringsForProperty {
                    net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/Bean.norm {
                    }
                }
                net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/Bean.norm {
                }
                net/sf/sdedit/ui/components/configuration/Bean.firePropertyChanged {
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
}}}
